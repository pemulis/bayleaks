<h1>Welcome to BayLeaks</h1>
<p id='tagline'>Is there something you'd like to share?</p>

<p>BayLeaks was created to support and enhance investigative journalism throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. We aim to promote governmental transparency and accountability, inspire powerful entities to act in the public interest, and preserve and uphold the principles of democracy and freedom of information.</p>

<p>BayLeaks uses an encrypted whistleblower submission system called SecureDrop to enable sources to securely share sensitive information that is newsworthy and relevant to the public interest. While using it requires careful attention to detail, this system provides strong anonymity for sources who wish to share information with the press that they believe the public has a right to know.</p>

<p>Information submitted via BayLeaks may be used as the basis for coverage by a Bay Area news outlet. BayLeaks is run by journalists and technologists who may opt to produce news reports of their own, or may partner with Bay Area media outlets to ensure that shared information is passed safely to media professionals with relevant expertise.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get started sharing information now, go directly to our <a href='#how-to'>BayLeaks Low Tech How-To Guide</a>. To learn more about BayLeaks, read on.</p>

<p><strong>Our SecureDrop server is currently offline for upgrades. You can still contact us through encrypted email at <a href='mailto:bayleaks@riseup.net'>bayleaks@riseup.net</a>. Scroll down for our GPG key.</strong></p>

<h2>About SecureDrop</h2>

<p>BayLeaks uses SecureDrop, a whistleblowing platform managed by the <a href='https://freedom.press'>Freedom of the  Press Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping support and defend public-interest journalism. SecureDrop was built with advanced cryptography software that is trusted by leading information security experts. BayLeaks’ SecureDrop submission site is what’s known as a Tor Hidden Service. These websites are only available through the use of Tor and can be much more secure than ordinary websites. Hidden services use .onion Web addresses (the .com or .org of the digital anonymity world). For a more detailed technical explanation of how SecureDrop works, please <a href='https://freedom.press/securedrop'>visit the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</a></p>

<h2>About protecting our sources</h2>

<p>BayLeaks offers sources a way to share information and files more securely than with conventional email or other electronic means. Used properly, SecureDrop ensures that a source may share information with the highest degree of confidentiality that experts in secure communication can technically provide. The system is designed to prevent your name, phone number, email addresses, IP address, or other identifying information from being revealed, unless you choose to make your identity known.</p>

<h2>About submitting to BayLeaks</h2>

<p>Specific instructions for sharing information are included in <a href='#how-to'>BayLeaks Low Tech How-To Guide</a>. Please follow the instructions carefully. Since our system was created with the highest level of digital security in mind, BayLeaks must be used conjunction with Tor, an online anonymity network that has gained the trust of Internet users around the world. The official <a href='https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en'>Tor Browser</a> is the easiest way to use Tor.</p>

<p>If you seek maximum confidentiality, we encourage you to boot your computer from a USB key containing the <a href='https://tails.boum.org/'>Tails secure operating system</a>, which includes the Tor Browser.</p>

<p>You can access our submission site at <strong>l7rt5kabupal7eo7.onion</strong></p>

<h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION BEFORE YOU BEGIN</h2>

<p>You should only log onto Tor via a public location, such as a library or a café. This offers greater security than submitting documents from a residence or place of employment, where it would be easier for a third party to detect you as a Tor user. After sharing information with BayLeaks, you may continue to communicate securely with the BayLeaks team through SecureDrop, using the codename you were assigned on your first visit.</p>

<p>Once you have finished sending documents, please take the precautionary step of destroying any recorded copies of your codename and erase and destroying any media (DVDs, USB sticks) used to copy the leaked documents. At that point, we also recommend deleting the Tor Browser Bundle.</p>

<h2>Sending encrypted email</h2>
<p>If you already have experience with secure communications software and you’d like to initiate a secure email exchange without using BayLeaks' SecureDrop system, you may send an encrypted email to the BayLeaks team at <a href='mailto:bayleaks@riseup.net'>bayleaks@riseup.net</a>.
